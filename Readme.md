This is a daughterboard for the Alpine RKJXT1F42001, so called "funky", switch. It is a very popular switch within the sim racing community (for example in steering wheels). Due to the fact that those switches can cost a lot when paired with daughterboards compared to there original price, I decided to design my own daughterboard. This is cheaper and is way more useable since I can use the original CAD data for my projects. Included in this repo is:
* the gerber files (can be directly used to build the PCB)
* CAD files
* original Altium files

FAQ:
Q: Why are there 4 PCBs in 1 Layout?
A: Manufacturers often have a limit for the PCB size. As long as a PCB is within that Limit it costs the same no matter what size it is. Thus manufacturing a small PCB is inefficient. The obvious way is to just put the same PCB on the layout and connect them with small bridges to make them a "single" PCB. But this does not work all the time because copying PCBs gets often detected. For such a simple PCB a valid workaround is just to route them slightly differently from each other which is exactly what was done here.
